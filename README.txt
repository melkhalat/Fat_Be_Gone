Once the development server is opened in your browser, you will see our login page where you can click on the 'Sign In With Google' button and you have the option to choose a Google account to log in with. 

After signing in, you will be redirected to our Nutrition page where you can search and add a food in either the Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks category. You can also navigate to our other links provided on this page such as to calculate your daily calorie goal by entering your information and if you would like to check your BMI using our BMI calculator.

In the header, you can access the Exercise and Community Forum pages as well. When you click on the Exercise page, you can create a new routine by selecting "Create Today's Routine" and it will take you to a screen to name your workout routine. After naming it, select "Add Exercises" and you can search an exercise from the list or if you would like to filter it through the categories you can do that too. After adding the exercises, select "Apply Changes" and it will automatically store for that workout routine. On the footer, you can also select "Exercise Descriptions" to view how exactly each exercise works. When you're finished you can click on "Finish" and it will add the routine to "Saved Routines" which you can view anytime and you have the option to save, edit, or delete that routine. You also have the option to add how many minutes you did the workout for and how many calories you burned while doing it.

When you click on the Community Forum page, you can enter text or insert an image or video in the textbox that says "Start posting here" and when you click the submit button it will show up below. You also have the option to edit your own post or delete it. There are also two buttons on the right side where you can either select the Nutrition or Exercise buttons to return to those pages.
